
This is a straight port of XLife to Microsoft Windows. No attempt has been made to modify
the program to be more like a Windows application; the object of the exercise was to get
XLife to compile under Windows without modifying the source code in any way. This has been
achieved using a simple X11 emulation library (X11Lib) to implement enough of the X11
standard (plus a few Unix functions) to get XLife to run.

For those unfamiliar with Xlife, press 'l' to load a file (a good example is "breeder")
then press 'g' to start generating. For a list of all commands, press '?'.
