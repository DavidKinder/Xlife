23/3 		- the default, of course
34/34
1234/3 		- patterns "crystalize"
12345/45 	- patterns become contained
12345/4 	- same as above, but settles VERY quickly
5/12 		- floor tile patterns... Variations of this 
			tend to be interesting as well.
/2 		- most patterns expand indefinitely, 
			some interesting ones. Fast gliders.
