#I now looks in pattern directory if file is not found in working directory
[this has been superceded--see ADDED]

'o' now redisplays pattern after doing a generation

(shift) doesn't cause last keystroke to come back.

Cursor mask includes border around cursor (so it will show up on white 
background).

Resizing works.  Input and coordinate windows are given correct sizes.

Non-keystroke events are handled during text input.

Horizontal scroll point is computed from size of input window.

#P now computes y coordinate of a line in a picture as position in file 
*relative* to #P (used to be absolute line number).  
MAY CAUSE INCOMPATIBILITY WITH PATTERNS CREATED UNDER AN EARLIER VERSION.

Deletecell doesn't allocate new cellbox.  New routine looklink.
